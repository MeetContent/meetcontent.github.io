This site was created using Docusaurus and is fully self-hosted on GitHub.

You can host a site for free as well, thanks to GitHub pages. Well, I say free,
but I guess all free services have a hidden cost. Irregardless, it's free in the
sense that the monetary cost is zero.

In a nutshell here's how you can get there:

1. Set up a repo on GitHub. If you want quick results, name your repo after your
   GitHub org, for example if your org is called "MeetContent", your repo should
   be called `meetcontent.github.io`.
1. Set up a site in your repo. If you want to go with Docusaurus, check out
   their [getting started](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).
1. To deploy your site, you need designate a branch where your built site will
   be deployed. The most common convention is to use a branch called `gh-pages`.

1. Set up your
   [Docusaurus deployment through GitHub actions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages).

Your site will be available on your org's default web address, for example

https://meetcontent.github.io

One big thing is that you get HTTPS for free!

If you want a custom domain, you can do that by pointing an external domain to
your GitHub pages.
