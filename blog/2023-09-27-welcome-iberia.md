The community is lead by a distributed team from Spain, and they have just set up a [newsletter](https://meetcontent.github.io/iberia#newsletter-title), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/100016156/) space and [Slack](https://meetcontent.slack.com/archives/C05EFGQ3XPD) channel (if that slack link doesn't work, make sure your account has [joined the MeetContent space](https://join.slack.com/t/meetcontent/shared_invite/enQtNDUyNDI2ODY2MTEyLTJmMjkxMGYwZjgwOTJhYjNjMzU5MWVjODNkYmZiNThkMDE4MDQzOTA0ODRhZTM2MDRkNmRiMTE3NWM4MmU2NzI)).
