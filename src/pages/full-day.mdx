# Hello, content community!

With a truly broken heart we received the news about the soap! conference not
happening this year. But once the first wave of sadness has passed, we wiped
away our tears, blew off the dust from our keyboards, and decided we want to
meet all of you this year anyway!

Join us at **#ContentDay**!

- **What?** A full day MeetContent event, with workshops and presentations.
- **When?** June 8, 2024 
- **Where?** Institute of English Studies at Jagiellonian University, KrakÃ³w
