  <summary>**To commit or not to commit - Considering estimation in a Tech Writing team** with Monika Mrozek (Ocado Technology)</summary>
  <div>
    As a team we had no reliable measure to prove that we needed more people.

    We needed a method to confidently state our capacity and act as a predictable partner to the functions we cooperated with.
    We had no way to prove how our workload changes over time - a simple 'closed task count' was not an option as we had no way to compare the task size.

    We set off with an assumption that although a writer‚Äôs work varies greatly from task to task, there are repeatable components of that work that we can identify and isolate. 

    We organized a workshop and made it into a team effort. 

    We said that there are tasks that are smaller or larger than others. We then set the list of all the types of documentation updates we produce in an order: this is bigger than this, this is smaller and this is more less equal to that. 
    We now have 2 months worth of data. 

    Main takeaways
    - Solve real problems using estimation. Don't do this for the sake of doing it. 
    - Engage the team and agree this collectively.
    - Estimation is a work in progress and you must be prepared to RECALIBRATE. Treat it as an ongoing experiment. Present your findings, draw conclusions, make hypotheses and confirm or refute them by continuing to gather data. 
    - This is a great opportunity for people to validate their thinking against the other views in the team.
