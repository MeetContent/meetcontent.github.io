Well, I say free,\\nbut I guess all free services have a hidden cost. Irregardless, it\'s free in the\\nsense that the monetary cost is zero.\\n\\nIn a nutshell here\'s how you can get there:\\n\\n1. Set up a repo on GitHub. If you want quick results, name your repo after your\\n   GitHub org, for example if your org is called \\"MeetContent\\", your repo should\\n   be called `meetcontent.github.io`.\\n1. Set up a site in your repo. If you want to go with Docusaurus, check out\\n   their [getting started](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).\\n1. To deploy your site, you need designate a branch where your built site will\\n   be deployed. The most common convention is to use a branch called `gh-pages`.\\n   [Read more on GihBub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).\\n1.
