# Simplified Technical English

We welcome you to our second meetup dedicated to STE (Simplified Technical
English), a popular controlled language specification originally stemming from
the aerospace industry. This will be a more practical session where we shall
discuss the first steps in using STE when authoring content.

This MeetContent event is graciously hosted by Etteplan Poland.
