# Simplified Technical English

A popular quote states that “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t
understand it well enough.” Though most technical communicators would in
principle agree, we are also aware achieving the right level of simplicity is no
trivial matter.

Enter controlled languages. In this meetup we will discuss the principles and
first usage steps of STE (Simplified Technical English), a popular controlled
language specification originally stemming from the aerospace industry. Come
join us for the first of two events hosted by Etteplan Poland
