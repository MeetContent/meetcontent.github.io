# AR documentation? Our experiments with Microsoft HoloLens

You probably have heard about Augmented Reality in the context of education or
gaming, but have ever considered how AR may be useful in technical
documentation? Join us to discuss this exciting paradigm shift, with examples
from an actual attempt to bring telecommunication docs into AR.

This MeetContent event is graciously hosted by Nokia.
