# Not your dad’s style guide: The Content Design Guide. How to help devs write better docs


Do software developers actually enjoy writing? Do technical writers really follow their own style guides? How much tool configuration is needed in a style guide?

Join us to explore the Content Design Guide, crafted by the Ocado Internal Tech Comms team to make writing documentation not just better but enjoyable for developers.

Whether you're a developer looking to level up your writing skills or a writer eager to bridge the gap with tech folks, this is your chance to rethink the role of a style guide. Together, let’s make documentation a little less daunting—and a lot more effective—one sentence at a time.
