# Creating Spare Parts Catalogues

This session is dedicated to an important, yet sometimes overlooked, kind of
documentation: Spare Parts Catalogues. These docs are the primary source of
information about parts needed for proper service, maintenance and repair of
machines. They are indispensable for service technicians and technical
specialists, and come with their own set of features setting them apart from
other kinds of technical content.

This MeetContent event is graciously hosted by DeLaval.
