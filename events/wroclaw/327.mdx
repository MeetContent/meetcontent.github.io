# MeetContent WRO #6

The Agile Manifesto suggests we should focus on producing working software over
comprehensive documentation. Over, not instead. Could this be achieved by
documenting side-by-side the code, keeping the documentation as close as
possible to the code? How about maintaining this documentation in the same way
we work with the code itself?

This event is organized in cooperation with
[Networked Assets](https://www.networkedassets.com/).
