# Writer’s horror story. How to overcome a writer’s block

In October, the #29 MeetContentWRO will be hosted by Infor.

We come back with a new meetup and since it’s going to be around the time of trick or treating, we have [Anna Józala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-j%C3%B3zala-5008a453/) treating you with the presentation: Writer’s horror story. How to overcome writer’s block.

Anna will highlight common obstacles that Writers encounter while writing, and will offer practical strategies to overcome them. 

Anna’s presentation will focus specifically on the writing part of the Technical Writer’s job.

Curious to know more? We’ll be talking about the following (and more!):
 ·        Planning your work and staying motivated
 ·        Dealing with distractions
 ·        Starting the writing process
 ·        Overcoming procrastination

As the MeetContent meeting is close to Halloween, the presentation will be presented in the film noir theme 🎃 👻

Sign up and see you on 30 October!
