# How to DITA without DITA and To commit or not to commit?

In April, the #27 MeetContentWRO will be hosted by Ocado.

And this time - just like we did the last time at Ocado - we will have two presentations:

* [Paweł Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawel-martin/) who is a Technical Writer at Ocado, will talk about *Hats, Snakes, and Portals* or in other words: *How to DITA without DITA* 😉

    We’ll find out about implementing technical documentation based on Spotify’s Backstage. For that, Paweł will briefly take us through what the Backstage offers in terms of tech docs and how it’s applied to document Ocado’s Technology Platform (OTP).

    Paweł will also discuss how to provide DITA-like functionality when you only have markdown - so how to DITA with no DITA 🧐

* [Monika Mrozek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-mrozek/) who works as a Lead Technical Writer at Ocado will reflect on the topic of estimation and consider with us whether *To commit or not to commit*.

    Is it possible for Tech Writers to estimate their work and how to go about this? 
    
    We will learn a story about one team’s effort to drive awareness and bring more clarity about the work they are committing to. Wonder how they fared?
 


Well, you’ll have to wait till 24 April 😉

Join us at Ocado!
