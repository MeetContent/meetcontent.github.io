# How to DITA without DITA and To commit or not to commit?

In April, the #27 MeetContentWRO will be hosted by Ocado.

And this time - just like we did the last time at Ocado - we will have two presentations:

* [PaweÅ‚ Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawel-martin/) who is a Technical Writer at Ocado, will talk about *Hats, Snakes, and Portals* or in other words: *How to DITA without DITA* ðŸ˜‰

    Weâ€™ll find out about implementing technical documentation based on Spotifyâ€™s Backstage. For that, PaweÅ‚ will briefly take us through what the Backstage offers in terms of tech docs and how itâ€™s applied to document Ocadoâ€™s Technology Platform (OTP).

    PaweÅ‚ will also discuss how to provide DITA-like functionality when you only have markdown - so

* [Monika Mrozek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-mrozek/) who works as a Lead Technical Writer at Ocado will reflect on the topic of estimation and consider with us whether *To commit or not to commit*.

    Is it possible for Tech Writers to estimate their work and how to go about this? 
    
    We will learn a story about one teamâ€™s effort to drive awareness and bring more clarity about the work they are committing to. Wonder how they fared?
 


Well, youâ€™ll have to wait till 24 April ðŸ˜‰

Join us at Ocado!
