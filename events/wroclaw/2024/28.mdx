# Knowledge transfer and retention and Visual Design in Technical Communication


In May, the #28 MeetContentWRO will be hosted by Etteplan.

There seems to be a pattern emerging here, this time around we will also have two presentations ðŸ¤©

[Basia Kardel-PiÄ…tkowska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-kardel-piatkowska/?originalSubdomain=pl), who is a Senior Documentation Specialist at Etteplan will kick off with a question: *Do you know what you donâ€™t know?*

Starting a new project or a new job can be stressful. In the end itâ€™s always about knowing what to do, how to do it, and with whom.  

Each small step in the process, each piece of knowledge can get us a long way if captured and recorded properly. Basia will talk about how to make sure everyone who needs the information has easy access to it

The second presentation of the evening will be delivered by [Maciek ChudaÅ„ski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciekchudanski/), who is a Lead Visual Designer at Etteplan.

Maciek, as you can already suspect will talk to us about *Visual Design in Technical Communication*.
Maciek will also start with a question: *Is the Tech Writerâ€™s job all about content?* 

His answer is: *Yes, but no* ðŸ˜‰
Weâ€™ll learn about the laws of human perception that may work for or against us. Weâ€™ll speak about principles, patterns, and best practices to design and organize content in a more pleasing and easy-to-understand way.

Sign up and see you on 22 May! ðŸ˜Ž
