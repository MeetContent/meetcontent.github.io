# UnBOXing API documentation

The MeetContentWRO #24 will focus on API. Our speaker, Barbara Czyż, works as the Senior Technical Writer and is responsible for creating developer documentation at Box. She is also one of the organizers of MeetContentKRK.
As the topic suggests, Basia will unBox their approach to the developer documentation.
Basia will talk about:
• The question of ownership - who should create these docs and how
• Content organization - how to make it meaningful and helpful
• Handling changes and improvements
We will learn a few examples from the Box API docs and explore how an idea of a new API is transformed into a fully documented API spec. As we go through the process, we’ll discuss tools, various documentation approaches, and best practices that support cooperation.
