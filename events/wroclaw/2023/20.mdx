# Be a-head of the game: Video game localization for rookies

MeetContentWRO would like to invite you to another great event in May.

Level up your localization game with our upcoming presentation, where we’ll show you the magic behind making your favorite games and other products accessible worldwide!
Once we’re done, you’ll know all the -zations, including globalization, internationalization and localization. We will show you how it’s done, how we would like it to be done and what kind of enemies Loc Teams have to face on their way. Of course, no fight makes sense without arming up beforehand, so our mission plan includes discussing tools used in the process as well.
You cannot miss it 🙂 

### How to get to the event?
The Ten Square Games office is located in the City Forum One building, at Traugutta 45. The best way to get to the venue is by tram (“Plac Wróblewskiego” stop).
Look out for the entrance to the building marked with the MeetContent and Ten Square Games logos.
Please arrive no later than 5:50 p.m. There in the lobby, wait for the person who will let you into the 1st floor, where the meetup will take place.
After 6pm, the doors to the building automatically close and only open from the inside. Therefore, people who are late are asked to inform the organizers - then someone from Ten Square Games will come down to pick you up. For everyone’s convenience, however, please be early 🙂
