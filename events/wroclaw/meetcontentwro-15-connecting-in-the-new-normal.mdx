# Connecting in the new normal

Half of 2020 behind us already, and what a ride has it been! Strange year
indeedâ€”we hope you and yours are holding up fine. Now that most of our
professional lives is happening remotely, we thought we should give a try to the
webinar format.

We are happy to have two extraordinary speakers joining us as we taste the
waters of the virtual meetup:

Marta Bartnicka, presenting us her experience with Next door neighbors:
Localization and Technical Communications.

Wojciech Froelich, who will introduce us to
[tekom Polska](https://www.technical-communication.org/tekom/about-us/country-organizations/poland/home),
the Polish branch of the largest professional association for technical
communication worldwide.
