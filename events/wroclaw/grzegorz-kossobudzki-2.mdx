# Two formats, one source – Topic-based writing in Flare 2/3

Topic-based writing is the cornerstone of modern technical communication,
enabling efficiency levels previously unavailable with traditional approaches.
MadCap Flare is a powerful tool that can turn your topics into almost any kind
of output. Come join us in this workshop, the second in a series of three events
dedicated to content production in Flare. For a detailed look at the event’s
agenda, click here.

This event is organized in cooperation with 3di and the Poland MadCap Flare User
Group (PLFUG).
