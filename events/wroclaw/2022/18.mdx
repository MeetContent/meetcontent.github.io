# UnBOXing API documentation

The MeetContentWRO #24 will focus on API. As the topic suggests, Basia will unBox their approach to the developer documentation.

Basia will talk about:
- The question of ownership - who should create these docs and how
- Content organization - how to make it meaningful and helpful
- Handling changes and improvements

We will learn a few examples from the Box API docs and explore how an idea of a new API is transformed into a fully documented API spec. As we go through the process, weâ€™ll discuss tools, various documentation approaches, and best practices that support cooperation.
