# Automate documentation publishing with Jenkins

What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word
“automation”? You may think it’s a costly venture into the unknown that only
developers are cut out for. But it doesn’t always have to be that way. You don’t
need to jump immediately at creating a solution for the entire department of 100
people. You can find a small project and automate documentation publishing for a
few authors. And Jenkins can help you with that.
