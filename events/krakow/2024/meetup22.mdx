# Searching for the common ground: a quest for a universal style guide

Style guides are both useful and remarkably contentious. In this presentation, 
Adam will compare three of them. Two are extremely influential, while the third not so much, 
but it is worth examining nonetheless. He will take a critical look at the general guidelines 
and specific lexical suggestions. He will attempt to synthesize and come up with some universal principles. 
Will the attempt be successful? Likely not, but sometimes _the journey, not the arrival, matters_.

Considered style guides:
- Google developer documentation style guide
- Microsoft Style Guide
- Splunk Style Guide
