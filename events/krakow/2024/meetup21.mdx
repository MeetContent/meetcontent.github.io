# Direction: product. Navigating career beyond content

If you ever wondered what a career in product looks like, where to start, 
and if your background in technical writing could give you a head start, 
Kasia’s story might be what you’re looking for. Kasia will tell us how she 
became a product manager after starting her career in tech comm, what tech 
writing skills gave her an upper hand, and which skill gaps she needed to 
fill in. Join us in learning about what the careers in tech writing and product 
management have in common, and then ask Kasia all your burning questions about 
working in product. The presentation will be directed both towards people 
who have a grasp of the product manager’s role and those who would like to 
learn about it.
