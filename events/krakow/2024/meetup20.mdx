# Emancipation: Why the heck would a tech writer use enterprise tools?

Enterprise tech writing tools are expensive. They do bring a lot to the table,
but for the price, are they worth it? We are looking at a scenario which has the
potential to replace a huge CCMS solution from a serious vendor with
community-supported open-source tools. Do the costs of maintenance swell up to
justify the vendor fee? And what situations are better for open source vs.
enterprise? Is it time for a revolution? Come and find out.
