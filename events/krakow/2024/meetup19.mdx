# Simplified Technical English. Keeping it simple and (not so) stupid.

Let’s kick off this year by talking about Simplified Technical English and its
implications towards the users! Why do we simplify English? Who wants to
simplify it? How does simplification help the user? And is it just another
shackles for the technical writer?

## About our sponsor

MeetContentKRK #19 is sponsored by ASSA ABLOY!

Krakow Innovation Center is where several ASSA ABLOY Group engineering
organizations collaborate: HID, DAS EMEIA, Group Technology Team and Global
Solutions. The nature of our work requires constant development, so we
incessantly improve our skills and respond to what is happening around us. We
hire almost three hundred specialists whose experience, passion and desire to
create a better world, are the backbone of the Kraków Innovation Center. This
allows us to fully engage in a given project - from developing a concept to
translating it into concrete products. Thanks to that, we can boast a broad
services and solutions portfolio that makes the world safer. We create
technology solutions that make the world safer, yet more open. From mobile ID
badges to the most advanced access systems. You’ll find them, literally,
everywhere - at homes, government institutions, airports, hospitals or schools.
