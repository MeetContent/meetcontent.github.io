# High-quality docs make high-quality products

As someone once said: _The product is docs_. So we already know the connection
between the two is strong, but how to make sure it is beneficial to both sides?

Let's talk about how documentation can improve the overall quality of the
product. We will explore the kinds of docs created during the development
process and how they can help us build better products. All that supported by
real-life examples!
