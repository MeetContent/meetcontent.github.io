# Two formats, one source – Topic-based writing in Flare 1/3

Topic-based writing is the cornerstone of modern technical communication,
enabling efficiency levels previously unavailable with traditional approaches.
Yet topic-based writing also means that content creators are tasked with
managing complex file systems, with the additional challenge of ensuring that
the proper output is generated. MadCap Flare is a powerful tool that can turn
your topics into almost any kind of output, and I’m going to show you how.

Come join us in this workshop, the first in a series of three events dedicated
to content production in Flare.

The event is organized in cooperation with 3di and the Poland MadCap Flare User
Group (PLFUG).
