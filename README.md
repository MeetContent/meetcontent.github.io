## How to add a meetcontent event

add a new `.mdx` file under the appropriate sub-folder within [events](events). Use the existing files for reference.

## How to add an article/blog post

- **KrakÃ³w and WrocÅ‚aw**: add a new `.md` or `.mdx` file under [blog](blog), tagging it with the appropriate division (`krakow`, `wroclaw`). Use the existing files for reference.

- **Iberia**: add a new `.md` or `.mdx` file under [blog-iberia](blog-iberia). Use the existing files for reference.

## How to edit a division landing page

The content that appears before the call to action buttons lives in the `.tsx` files under [src/pages](src/pages).

## Techy Website details

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to
build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
